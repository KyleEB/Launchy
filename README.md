# üöÄ Launchy - Application Launcher for CachyOS

A modern, fast application launcher built with Wails3 and Svelte for CachyOS and other Linux distributions.

## Features

- **üîç Smart Search**: Search applications by name, description, or categories
- **üé® Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive interface with smooth animations
- **‚ö° Fast Performance**: Built with Wails3 for native performance
- **üîß Clean Architecture**: Follows Clean Code and Clean Architecture patterns

## Architecture

This project follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

### Backend (Go)
- **AppService**: Main service layer handling business logic
- **AppRepository**: Interface for data operations (implemented as FileAppRepository)
- **AppLauncher**: Interface for launching applications (implemented as SystemAppLauncher)
- **DesktopFileParser**: Interface for parsing .desktop files

### Frontend (Svelte)
- **App.svelte**: Main application component
- **SearchBar.svelte**: Search functionality with debouncing
- **AppCard.svelte**: Individual application card component

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Node.js 18 or later
- Wails3 CLI

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Launchy
   ```

2. Install Wails3 CLI:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails3@latest
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

### Development

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
wails3 dev
```

This will start the application with hot-reloading for both frontend and backend changes.

### Building

To build the application for production:

```bash
wails3 build
```

This creates a production-ready executable in the `build` directory.
