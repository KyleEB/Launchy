## Architecture

This project follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

### Backend (Go)
- **AppService**: Main service layer handling business logic
- **AppRepository**: Interface for data operations (implemented as FileAppRepository)
- **AppLauncher**: Interface for launching applications (implemented as SystemAppLauncher)
- **DesktopFileParser**: Interface for parsing .desktop files

### Frontend (Svelte)
- **App.svelte**: Main application component
- **SearchBar.svelte**: Search functionality with debouncing
- **AppCard.svelte**: Individual application card component
- **FavoritesSection.svelte**: Favorites display section

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Node.js 18 or later
- Wails3 CLI

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Launchy
   ```

2. Install Wails3 CLI:
   ```bash
   go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails@latest
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

### Development

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
wails3 dev
```

This will start the application with hot-reloading for both frontend and backend changes.

### Building

To build the application for production:

```bash
wails3 build
```

This creates a production-ready executable in the `build` directory.

## Installation

### Arch Linux

Launchy can be installed on Arch Linux using the provided PKGBUILD:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Launchy

   The application will also be available in your desktop environment's application menu.

### Other Linux Distributions

For other distributions, build from source:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install golang-go nodejs npm
   
   # Fedora
   sudo dnf install golang nodejs npm
   
   # Arch Linux (if not using PKGBUILD)
   sudo pacman -S go nodejs npm
   ```

2. **Install Wails3 CLI:**
   ```bash
   go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails@latest
   ```

3. **Build the application:**

## Development Guidelines

### Go Best Practices
- Follow Clean Architecture principles
- Use interfaces for dependency inversion
- Implement proper error handling with wrapped errors
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and types

### Svelte Best Practices
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper event handling with `createEventDispatcher`
- Follow component composition patterns
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Implement accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Code Style
- Use consistent formatting (gofmt for Go, Prettier for Svelte)
- Follow naming conventions
- Write self-documenting code
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful commit messages
